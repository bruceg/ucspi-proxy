.TH ucspi-proxy 1
.SH NAME
ucspi-proxy \- Copy data between a UCSPI client and server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ucspi-proxy
[
.I \-v
] [
.I \-t TIMEOUT
] [
.I HOST PORT
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program is a simple loop copying data from a UCSPI server (file
descriptor 0) to a client, and from a client to a server (FD 1).  If
either socket closes,
.B ucspi-proxy
exits.  The other
.B ucspi-proxy-*
programs are based on this simple loop and have similar usage.

If
.I HOST
and
.I PORT
are given on the command line,
.B ucspi-proxy
will make a TCP connection with the given parameters.  If neither are
present,
.B ucspi-proxy
will use file descriptor 6 for the client socket, as provided by UCSPI
client programs.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-l MAXLINE
The maximum length of lines (from either server or client) to copy to
the log. Defaults to 64.
.TP
.I \-s ADDRESS
Set the local source address for outbound connections.
Use
.B auto
to take the address from the original socket address.
.TP
.I \-t TIMEOUT
When making an connection,
.B ucspi-proxy
will wait a maximum of
.I TIMEOUT
seconds before giving up.  Defaults to 30.
.TP
.I \-T TIMEOUT
.B ucspi-proxy
will exit after
.I TIMEOUT
seconds of inactivity on both sockets.
Defaults to no timeout.
.TP
.I \-v
Print messages about errors and byte counts.  Without this option,
.B ucspi-proxy
is silent.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Exits 0 if a normal end of file was reached on one of the sockets.
Otherwise it exits 1.
