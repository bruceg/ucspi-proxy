-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.96

- Major internal rewrite.
- Moved the server connect handler into the proxy program.  This allows
  for useful custom error messages (including system error strings) when
  the connection fails.
- Add the PID to all output messages, to allow for correlation.
- Moved the "delay" parameter from the relay filters to an environment
  variable, defaulting to 5 minutes.
- Added hostname suffixing support to the POP3 and IMAP proxies,
  removing the "relay" from their filenames since they do more than just
  relay control now.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.95

- The relay proxy programs now parse the username and display it
  (including extracting data from base64-encoded strings).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.94

- Added a translating HTTP proxy.

- Fixed a bug in the core ucspi-proxy client write routine that treated
  an interrupted (short) write as a failure.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.93

- The relay proxy programs now take the relay rerun delay and relay
  authorization command as command-line parameters, rather than being
  hard-coded into the programs.

- Fixed a bug in the Makefile that would make "make install" fail if you
  didn't run "make" first.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.92

- Added support in the POP3 relay proxy for the "AUTH" command, used by
  CRAM-MD5 logins.

- All proxies now ignore several harmless signals that otherwise would
  kill the proxy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in version 0.91

- Added POP3 and IMAP proxies which trigger relay-ctrl-allow on
  successful logins.

- Added logging proxy, which writes all data to stderr.

- Fixed typo in tcp-proxy script.
